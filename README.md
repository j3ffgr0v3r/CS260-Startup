# What's Your Schedule?

[My Notes](notes.md)

Collaborative calendaring specifically designed for college students (though anyone could use it). Allows for schedule sharing and simplified event planning.


## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

College students are an interesting demographic when it comes to event planning. They so much want to hang out with friends and do fun activities, but while that stage in life is often seen as the most "liberating", they ironically struggle to find common free time among the classes, work hours, and other responsibilities. They all have free-time eventually, but finding a common free-time is always a hassle. **_What's Your Schedule_** allows college students (or anyone, for that matter) to easily share their schedule with friends, find common availability, and create event invitations to spend less time coordinating, and more time having fun!

### Design

![Design image](<UI Design.png>)

Here is a sequence diagram that shows how to people would interact with the backend to plan events.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor John
    actor Jane
    actor Alex
    John ->> Server: Schedule
    Jane ->> Server: Schedule
    Alex ->> Server: Schedule
    John ->> Server: Event Planning Request with: Jane and Alex
    Server -->> John: Best times for event
    John ->> Server: Event plan
    Server -->> Jane: Event plan/proposal
    Server -->> Alex: Event plan/proposal
    Jane -->> Server: RSVP
    Alex -->> Server: RSVP
```
